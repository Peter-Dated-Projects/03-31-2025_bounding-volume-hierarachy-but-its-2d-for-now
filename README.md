practice guys. practice.

## The Concept

So I want to first practice creating BVH's in python (my more comfortable language) before I jump over to C++ or some other language that isn't my favorite lmao.

In this project, I'm gonna create a simple... flock simulation? 

I guess?

How can I incorporate BVH into this though...

## The Plan

We will use a Bounding Volume Hierarchy to make collision detection between boids super duper fast :)

Then we can make the boids do random things lol.
